##Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM):Multi-Omics Analysis


Skin cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. It poses a significant public health concern globally, with increasing incidence rates reported in many countries.

Risk factors for skin cutaneous melanoma include excessive UV radiation exposure, fair skin complexion, history of sunburns, family history of melanoma, presence of atypical moles, certain genetic mutations, and weakened immune system. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent the spread of the cancer.

Recent studies have focused on the potential role of the human microbiota, the diverse community of microorganisms in and on the human body, in the development and progression of skin cutaneous melanoma. Analysis of bacterial communities in tumors and surrounding skin has been conducted, leading to the creation of the Bacterial In Cancer (BIC) database, which provides information on the abundance, diversity, and clinical relevance of bacteria associated with different cancer types, including skin cutaneous melanoma. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between the microbiota and the development of this aggressive form of skin cancer and to explore new diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies.
